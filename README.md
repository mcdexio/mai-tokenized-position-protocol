Mai Tokenized Position (TP) is used to convert a long position of [Mai Protocol v2 - Perpetual](https://github.com/mcdexio/mai-protocol-v2) into ERC20 token. A long position can be kept fully collateralized automatically, so it is possible to make a long position leave the Perpetual and enter the public Ethereum ecosystem.

For example: An ETH-PERP inverse perpetual is collteralized with ETH. So the short position (The short position is from a human perspective. In the contract it is still a long position) is a synthetic USD. A BTC-USDT-PERP vanilla perpetual is collteralized with USDT. So the long position is a synthetic BTC. etc.
